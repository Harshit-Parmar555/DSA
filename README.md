# DSA Journey with C++ ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! Here, I document my journey of solving problems in **C++** from various topics, focusing primarily on **Leetcode**. This repo serves as my personal collection of solutions and learning progress as I tackle common DSA problems.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm Harshit Parmar, a passionate **BTech CSE** student, on a mission to master **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Through this repository, I aim to:
- Sharpen my problem-solving skills
- Improve my C++ coding proficiency
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming contests

## ðŸ“… Problem Solving Journey
- **Current Focus**: Leetcode questions, covering a wide range of topics from **arrays** and **strings** to **graphs** and **dynamic programming**.
- **Languages Used**: C++
- **Difficulty Levels**: From **Easy** to **Hard**, with a focus on mastering the fundamentals before tackling more challenging problems.

## ðŸ”§ Topics Covered
Here are the major DSA topics I've worked on, with links to specific folders or files that contain the respective solutions:

- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees** (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)
- **Graphs** (BFS, DFS, etc.)
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**

Each folder contains problem-solving code, explanation, and the learning process for each problem.
